               <p>Pam Koziel-Thomas was born January 5th, 1954 in Fremont, Nebraska. She was born to parents
                Wanda and John Koziel. Wanda was born in Cozad, Nebraska and John was born in Fremont, 
                Nebraska. They both came from Polish ancestry. Wanda worked in the food industry and John fought 
                in the Korean War before getting a blue collar job at the local telephone company in Fremont, 
                Nebraska. My mother had one sibling, Jeff Koziel who unfortunately passed away at age 22 in a 
                motorcycle accident. She told me this was a very difficult experience for her and her parents. 
                </p>

                She enjoyed her time growing up in Fremont and the small town atmosphere. She went to a 
                private Catholic grade school and Fremont High for high school where she was a cheerleader. Her first
                job was working in the corn fields during the summer as corn detassler as a teenager. For college she 
                went to the University of Nebraska at Kearney where she studied social work. She considered going to
                law school but choose to pursue a career in social work where she worked for the Nebraska Department
                of Health and Humans Services for over 30 years. She married my father in 1988 and had two 
                children, myself in 1990 and my brother in 1994. She retired from social work in April 2020 and now 
                spends her time at home for the most part reading, watching tv, and taking care of her little black dog, 
                Storm.</p>
